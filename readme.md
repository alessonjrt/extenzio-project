# Extenzio: My First React Native Project with Expo

Welcome to **Extenzio**, my first React Native project developed with JavaScript and Expo! This application holds a special place in my learning journey, as it marks my humble beginnings in the world of mobile app development.

## Project Overview

Extenzio was developed as part of my high school coursework for a subject called "Project Integrator" at IFSC Campus Xanxere. While I have gained more experience and knowledge since then, this project serves as a cherished memory of where my mobile app development journey began.

## About the Code

### Acknowledging Errors and Bad Practices

I want to emphasize that this code contains errors and suboptimal practices. However, I've chosen to keep them intact to remind myself of my progress as a developer. It's a reminder that everyone starts somewhere, and learning from mistakes and growth is an essential part of the journey.

### Learning Experience

Extenzio represents my first foray into mobile app development with React Native and Expo. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience, and it laid the foundation for my future projects and coding adventures.

## Upcoming Refactoring

I want to mention that I plan to refactor this project soon. This refactoring will be an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills I've acquired since the initial development. It will serve as a testament to my ongoing growth as a developer.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference if you're starting your journey in mobile app development with React Native and Expo. While it may not be perfect, it serves as a valuable learning resource.

## Getting Started

To run Extenzio, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Expo and required dependencies.
3. Run the project using `expo start`.

## Feedback and Contributions

I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you have insights or contributions that can help me grow as a mobile app developer, please don't hesitate to reach out. Remember, we're all on a journey of continuous learning and improvement.

Thank you for joining me on this retrospective journey to my first React Native project, Extenzio. I hope it inspires and motivates you in your mobile app development endeavors.
